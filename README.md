# My-Fab-Academy-Website
Fab Academy Personal website Source Code. It's based on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. I love the grid system look and i feel that it's very comfortable so I decided to build my website assignments page in that look. Lemme tell you a secret! the website is responsive, can adapt it's components sizing to any screen size.

Feel free to edit, tweak and reuse this code. you can easily edit any of the weeks ".html" file to add your dope content inside.
